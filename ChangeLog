Coriander, (c) 2000-2001 Damien Douxchamps <douxchamps@ieee.org>

Changes in version 0.17-pre2, Sept 16, 2001, by Dan Dennedy:
    - capture.c: bugfix major memory leak in multi-capture
    - capture.c: bugfix capture failing with video1394 loaded 
      and porthole not open
    - capture.c: factor out some code to a convert_to_yuv()
      function to achieve symmetry with convert_to_rgb()
    - added different capture frequencies: immediate (as fast
      as possible) and periodic (every X secs)
    - added different capture mode: sequentially nubmer file or
      continually overwrite same file
    - added ftp client option to capture based upon FtpLib, which
      is detected with autoconf and handled appropriately.
    - tools.c: added MainStatus()
      
    Sept 17:
    - capture.c: optimize re-use of porthole buffer when capturing.
    - capture.c: increased counter capacity to limit of unsigned long
      and changed file format to include 10-digit number.
    - capture.c: apply speed detection code to a few more calls to
      dc1394_setup_capture.
    - capture.c, ftp: do not issue chdir if path is empty string.
    - tools.c: added MessageBox()
    - callbacks.c: enabling FTP without FtpLib invokes MessageBox.
    - added menu accelerators (see src/interface.mods)
    - removed international support from build
    
    Sept 18:
    - interface.c: bugfix the porthole window not scaling smoothly by adding
      a GtkAlignmentWidget
    - interface.c: remove the incomplete accelerator for video overlay 
      toggle button that was introduced yesterday.
    - callbacks.c: removed the on_camera_scope_size_allocate and
      on_camera_scape_size_request event handlers due to fix above.
    - capture.c: bugfix some dc1394_setup_catpure calls using the wrong
      handle introduced 2 days ago.

    Sept 24, by Damien Douxchamps:
    - in an attempt to use radio buttons in the format selection menu, I
      changed the format/mode menu building procedure. Some parts have been
      left commented out, waiting for Glade to support menu-radio buttons
      in a better way. Some definitions have been created in definitions.c.
    - changed the compilation order in src/Makefile.am: definitions and tools
      have been moved 'up'.
    - removed the 'BuildFormat7Ranges' prompt to stdout.
    - removed BuildFormat7Ranges.c file from CVS
    - created UpdateFTPFrame in update_frame.c from Dan's code. Added label
      shading to field shading in order to make things clearer. The function
      has been added in the UpdateCaptureFrame window.
    - some cosmetic UI changes in FTP frame
	
Changes in version 0.17-pre1, July 25, 2001:

	- true error handling: data not used when an error is detected.
	- Bug fix: added "gdk_rgb_init();" in IsoStartThread() (capture.c)
	  Thanks to John B. Burchett and Dan Dennedy.
	- due to the lack of updates I have removed the Japanese translation
	  files (besides, I've failed to integrate these for some time)
	- Corrected some format7 code thanks to Olaf Ronneberger: in
	  BuildFormat7ColorMenu and GetFormat7Capabilities, index like
	  (0x1 << i) must be changed to (0x1 << (31-i)) (total: 2 occurences)
	
Changes in version 0.16, June 25, 2001:

    - added first Status window implementation. Enabled status window
	  menu item in update_menus.c:line 42.
	- removed 250 lines in callbacks.c by creating ChangeModeAndFormat
	  function in tools.c
	- added a notice in the 'no camera found' warning window for those
	  who don't understand why their DV cameras are not detected (this
	  should people from sending stop tons of emails)
	- moved iso_check/resume functions to tools.c
	- added a checkbox in the test pattern menu item.
	- repaired capture button enable when iso restart is clicked.
	- added maximal speed detection for devices on the bus: no more
	  hard-typed SPEED_400!!!
	- first implementation of the status bar of the main window. This bar
	  is currently only for error reporting.
	
Changes in version 0.15, May 23, 2001:

	- added Dan's patch for capture & overlay
	- added Marcus Lim code for test pattern display
	
Changes in version 0.14, May 16, 2001:

        - fixes several bugs related to multi-camera support.
	- removed cameras dc1394_init in main()
	- added an overlay enable button for the used for whom the overlay
	  does not work well.
	
Changes in version 0.13, May 8, 2001:

	- Heavy code cleanup & bug fixes for overlay and capture. Thanks Dan!
	- some more bug fixes for multiple camera support. Note that overlay
	  does not work with multiple cameras.
	
Changes in version 0.12, April 25, 2001:

        - added Japanese language support
	- upgraded for compatibility with latest libdc1394
	- added some more format6 and format7 preliminary stuff
	- some more bug fixes
	
Changes in version 0.11, March 29, 2001:

	- Code update from Dan Dennedy for video overlay: much better threads
	  handeling.
	- First Format_6 window prototype
	- single/multi frame capture added by Dan Dennedy
          
Changes in version 0.10, March 19, 2001:

	- MASSIVE code update, cleanup and beautification. Functions of
	  different kinds are defined: update and build. These operate on
	  different objects: ranges, menus, frames and windows. This looks
	  more and more like C++... Build functions all end up by the
	  associated update function. Apart from that, build functions include
	  the building of their 'sons'.
	- Addition of a video overlay in the porthole window. Many thanks to
	  Dan Dennedy!! :-)
	- first implementation of Format_7 controls
	
Changes in version 0.09, Feb. 08, 2001:

	- changed several functions prototype to ...(void) instead of ...().
	  This implied several changes to the callbacks.c file.
	- added configure to the sources to try solving a compatibility
	  problem
	- corrected a window-size problem (Format_7 window)
	
Changes in version 0.08, Jan. 13, 2001:

	- iso flow control added in capture window: start/stop/restart
	- changed layout of main window
	- added the 'value' parameter for the external trigger ('count').
	  Trigger is now 99.9% completed (only testing remains)
	- added a little logo on the main window
	- replaced global feature & camera structures by global pointers to
	  these structures
	- introduced the camera selector menu
	- main.c now downloads data of all DC on the bus in a big structure.
	- changed all 'vboxes' that contained dynamic menus to 'tables' because
	  it allows correct positioning of dynamicaly created widgets.
	- introduced a new structure: dc1394_misc_info
	- check that all 'set' commands also set the 3 global camera structures
	- finished vectorization and multi-camera switching
	- option menus are now coherent with the camera setup even at boot.
	- framerate menu check that current framerate is available for 
	  format/mode. If not available, it switches to the nearest, preferably
	  lowest framerate available
	- changed several constant index/boundaries and use instead DC1394
	  definitions (like NUM_FRAMERATES,...)
	
Changes in version 0.07, Jan. 08, 2001:

	- intoduced Format_7 window
	- fixed a bug in auto/man mode: each one issued a callback at
	  each state change so I removed the callbacks of AUTO mode and
	  generalized the MAN mode callback.
	- iso flow is interrupted before fps/format/mode change and retored
	  after the change. This avoids hangups in other programs using the
	  iso flow.
	- update ranges when exiting from auto mode (ONLY WORKING FOR WHITEBAL
	  when using DFW-VL500 bacause it seems this camera does not update all
	  its registers in auto mode !)
	- removed disable of iris/gain/shutter during auto exposure (it was
	  meaningless)

	
Changes in version 0.06, Jan. 04, 2001:

	- corrected trigger features: now 99.9% operational
	- corrected load/save memory feature: now 100% operational
	- uses new functions of libdc1394 for trigger, memory and Format_7
	- simplified fps menu generation & update
	- changed some functions names (Build-)
	- use of the dc1394_feature_set structure throughout the program
	  as an information repository (synch'd w/ camera)
	- clearly dinstinguish ACTIVATE (at boot or camera select) and
	  UPDATE (changing values)
	- DO NOT set any control in update functions (this yields a callback,
          then an update, thus a callback,... == infinite loop!)
	- auto exposure disables iris, gain and shutter
	- callback functions data as pointers to avoid warnings

	
Changes in version 0.05, Jan. 02, 2001:

	- ( first release )
	- introduced the "Coriander" name (_that_ was a difficult change!)
	- improved 0.02 in many ways
	- temperature settings
	- capture settings
	- OP auto: momentary disable the command while working
	- auto mode: disable range value (it should be updated regularly)
	- dynamic option menus for fps and trigger mode
	- new 'About' window (Gnome default look)


Changes in version 0.02, Dec. 29, 2000:

        - first signal connections for scale widgets (?)

	
Changes in version 0.01, Dec. 27, 2000:

        - first alpha version, still a lot of stuff missing...
