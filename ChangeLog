   - fixed service buttons update on camera change
	
   April 28, 2003, by Paul Rybski
   - fixed conversion bug for YUV444->RGB mode.
	
   April 25, 2003, by Damien Douxchamps
   - absolute values are updated when moving the normal control sliders
	
   April 22, 2003, by Damien Douxchamps
   - removed most of err=dc1394... schemes by if (dc1394...!=DC1394_SUCCESS)
   - removed Real service, as it never worked and now all the Real system
     has changed, making it completely obsolete.
	
Changes in version 0.31

   April 19, 2003, by Damien Douxchamps
   - fixed the automatic iso restart when changing format,...
   - fixed freeing of unallocated buffer structs in threads 
   - changed status statusbar to textbox so it acts like a log.
   - fixed '-0.00' display of FPS.
   - fixed segfault when a service could not start. Failure is now logged.
   - removed CleanThreads() function, it is now useless thanks to the new
     buffer structure.
   - changed the failure messages for iso service
	
Changes in version 0.30

   April 14, 2003, by Damien Douxchamps
   - fixed big fat hairy YUV422 bug. Thanks again to Laurent and Vincent.
	
   April 10, 2003, by Damien Douxchamps
   - new GUI layout
	
Changes in version 0.29

   April 9, 2003, by Damien Douxchamps
   - fixed a display color bug with YUV 422 modes. Thanks to Laurent
     Bonnaud for spotting this.
	
   March 31, 2003, by Damien Douxchamps
   - added a stereo 'field' decoding format
   - stereo decoding allowed for YUV422 too (compatibility with Videre
     Design stereo heads)
	
   March 10, 2003, by Damien Douxchamps
   - added missing 'fclose' in thread_save.c 
   - removed *10 allocation used in debug in thread_iso.c
	
Changes in version 0.28

   March 6, 2003, by Damien Douxchamps
   - image color format is now coded in the iso thread with F7 color codes.
     It is no more required to check format/mode to have color info in
     following threads.
   - big buffer structure cleanup. Hopefuly this now works 100%
   - moved window menu in the file menu. 
	
   March 4, 2003, by Damien Douxchamps
   - only restart SDL if display size changes
   - only re-allocated thread-specific buffers if their size change.
   - remove test pattern button as if sometimes freeze the cameras.
	
   February 28, 2003, by Damien Douxchamps
   - fixed compiling issues with gcc 2.95
   - fixed a bug with the recently introduced buffer structure (display...
     threads created a segfault if images were not immediately available)
	
   February 27, 2003, by Damien Douxchamps
   - image filenames for save and FTP have a date/time appened instead
     of a long number. This date/time is the computer local time when
     the ISO thread got the frame (it is thus NOT the true capture time)
     The format is YEARMONTHDAY-HOURMINUTESECOND-MILLISECOND.
   - fixed NaN fps display.
	
   February 25, 2003, by Damien Douxchamps
   - improved image buffer structure, allows to change some parameters
     without restarting the thread.

   December 2, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - an awful bug that makes bayer color decoding end with a beautful
     segfault has been corrected.
	
Changes in version 0.27.1

   November 27, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - Sync with libdc
	
   November 24, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - updated the macro file to check for a recent libdc.
	
Changes in version 0.27

   November 20, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - Make a full update of the camera capabilities when we change the
     mode or format.
	
   November 19, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - Use gnome timeout functions to display FPS.
	
   November 18, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - updated F7 code window build/update. This was messy because there
     was among others some circular references (and a lot of other
     things).
	
   November 2, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - updated F7 code: a bug had been introduced on Oct. 31, plus
     some better handling of F7 control via SDL.
	
   October 31, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - misc code beautification in thread_iso.c
   - replaced all 'if (!dc1394_xxx)' by 'if (dc1394_xxx!=DC1394SUCCESS)
   - changed format7 window ranges layout
   - updated some text in the messages/about windows.
	
   October 24, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - updates to take unit_position into account.
	
   October 23, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - added an absolute setting functionality through a new
     "Absolute Settings" window.
	
Changes in version 0.26

   October 16, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - fixed convert button behavior for save service 
	
   October 15, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - changed step_x to step_y for the F7 range Y setting.
	
   September 30, 2002, by David Ergo
   - move dma_done_with_buffer at the end of IsoThread.
	
   September 27, 2002, by David Ergo
   - swapped dma_release and dma_unlisten functions in thread_iso.c
	
   September 24, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - first implementation of an live fps display. Nothing is shown
     right now because I can't get it to work with GTK. You can 
     uncomment some fprintf in the threads to have a console output.
	
   September 12, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - some F7 update about color mode changes
   - more bpp debugging
	
   September 11, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - added 'format_7' to f7 modes string in format menu.
   - little bit-per-pixel sensitiveness correction
   - update byte-per-packet when changing F7 mode
	
   September 10, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - added a bpp setting to get nice pictures from 16bpp modes used
     by less-than-16bpp cameras.
	
   September 7, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - corrected a bug in RGB to UYVY conversion function (column
     swapping)
	
   September 4, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - set sensitiveness of stereo decoding button
   - use custom names for display window title
   - don't use "node %d" for default camera names as the node number
     is then memorized as preferences, which in turns leads to the
     possibility that two camera names will contain the same node id.
	
   September 3, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - Stereo image decoding added (16bit->8+8bit)
	
   August 26, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - typo in Bayer menu corrected
   - small bayer code beautification
	
   August 23, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - added RGGB and GBRG bayer patterns. The pattern list is now
     exhaustive.
	
   August 22, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - added sensitiveness check for bayer menus. These are now only
     accessible when the mode is greyscale (8 or 16bpp)
	
   August 21, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - fixed a bug in nearest neighbor conversion (sx instead of sy...)
     Thanks to Xiong Quanren.
   - added a function to decode one 16bit stereo pair into two 8bit
     images
	
   - added bayer decoding with format_7
   - added alternative bayer decoding. Two patterns are now supported:
       BGGR: B G    and    GRBG: G R
	     G R                 B G
   - added another bayer decoding method that simply downsamples
     the image by a factor 2, using 4 bayer pixels to get 1 RGB pixel.
	
   August 20, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - support Y16 in bayer decoding
   - support PointGrey cameras (require libdc CVS 21-08-2002)

   August 14, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - linked bayer decoding functions. You have to restart the 
     services in order for the bayer options to be taken into account. 
	
   August 13, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - removed format6 window prototype
   - started integration of Bayer pattern decoding functions
   - debugged Bayer pattern decoding functions.
	
   August 12, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - New layout: more compact
   - New format selection menu: now you can see the current format (!)
   - removed all images in pixmap directory: we don't use these anymore.
     (This is partly because I don't want to advertise Sony anymore)
	
   August 9, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - Added another function to descramble Bayer pattern (Edge Sense 2).
     Not linked, currently for testing/devel only.
	
   August 6, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - more fixes for initial segfault when no card/modules are present
	
   August 5, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - updated macros/coriander-macros.m4 to check for latest changes
     in libdc1394.
	
   August 5, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps	
   - Applied Ryutaroh Matsumoto's patch for NULL pointer segfault in
     tools.c/MainError. Added the same if (commander_window!=NULL) to
     tools.c/MainStatus for safety.
	
   July 29, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - added a cursor information in the main window. Needs some
     improvements for some things behave in a strange way (a
     'void' fprintf is required in UpdateCursorFrame to make it
     work...) 
   - corrected an error detection bug: was checking for err==0
     while it should be err<0. This implied some other changes
     to functions that used error detection combinations. Thanks
     to L.C.Bruzenak and Dan for pointing it out.
	
   July 28, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - removed some problematic g_free that hanged coriander.
	
   July 27, 2002, by Dan Dennedy
   - added video1394 drop frames preferences option to sync with 
     new option in libdc1394.

   July 15, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - added #ifdef HAVE_SDLLIB for watchthread related code
	
   July 8, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - use raw1394_get_port_info to get the number of ports, as Dan
     Dennedy suggested.
	
   July 5, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - Updated the status window
   - changing the name affects the menu immediately.
   - updated the preferences mechanism. You don't need to push the
     'apply' button anymore
	
   July 4, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - Multiple interface card support, beta version.
   - you can now name any connected camera. The choosen name
     will appear in the camera list menu and should help to
     distinguish between different cameras, even after bus reset or
     power off. It is based on GUID recognition. The name is saved
     in the config file with other preferences.
	
Changes in version 0.25

   July 2, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - Capture bugfixes from Clay Kunz.
	
   July 1, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - added a basic function fo Bayer pattern decoding (for Basler
     cameras)
	
   Apr 15, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - changed the raw output selection: it is now an option in the
     preferences window. The 'raw' extention is no longer mendatory. 
   - added a 'sequence' option in the scratch options for saving.
     Selecting this option will let you write continuous video
     sequences to disk. This mode is only available with raw dumping
     option. 
   - updated and applied Dan's patch for interface.c.
	
   Apr 08, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - Fixed a serious bug in propagation of images within the image
     pipe. This leaded to duplicate images in file saving,...
	
   Mar 28, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - updated version check macro for libdc1394.
	
   Mar 26, 2002, by Dan Dennedy
   - change calls to raw1394_destroy_handle to dc1394_destroy_handle
     requires updated libdc1394 from CVS.

   Mar 24, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - finished the interactive region selection for F7.
   - added the 'm' shortcut to switch to max size in F7.
	
   Mar 23, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - changed the F7 range update policy to 'delayed': the value only
     changes when the mouse does not move. This avoid continuous
     format changes and allow the threads to be restarted a reasonable
     number of times.
   - the ranges for F7 now respect the stepping values thanks to some
     range tweaking.
	
   Mar 21, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - added a key bindings window in the help menu.

Changes in version 0.24:

   Mar 18, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - corrected a bug in the strings: the program crashed when a
     preference string was changed twice. Thanks to 'inet' SF user.
	
   Mar 17, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - started to implement an interactive format selection for
     format7. This is necessary because the sliders do not respect
     the 'step' argument the way I wanted. Currently, you can draw
     a window using the left mouse button, and you can clear it
     by pressing 'c'. the 'c' key will be used for cropping.
	
   Mar 16, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - added GUID display in status window
   - more F7 debug (ranges adjustments)
	
   Mar 15, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - lots of bugfixes for format7, trigger, and user interface.
   - more bugfixes for format7 color coding.
	
   Mar 5, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - updated the capture function calls for Format7 compatibility.
     This is just a quick hack, it will be tested further.
	
   Mar 4, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - corrected a bug in the timeout loops (added '==DC1394_TRUE')
	
   Feb 27, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - added some code to the color conversion functions so that
     they now work with format7.
   - updated the color conversion functions, again... The problems
     encountered by some users are related to the video card, so
     I set the default SDL mode to YUY2, and changed the color
     conversion accordingly.
	
   Feb 19, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - Updated the Real functions that would not compile anymore.
	
   Feb 18, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - the color problem is in SDL, not in coriander. Stay tuned.
   - small config bugs corrected
	
   Feb 14, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - more color conversion bugs corrected. Will this ever end?
   - removed a "/n" in build_menus.c
	
Changes in version 0.23:

   Feb 11, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - finished gnome-config integration
   - corrected minor bugs, as usual.
	
   Feb 8, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - more configure macros update: added MMX/SSE/SSE2 detection for
     future assembler-optimized conversion functions. Also separate
     presence/version detection for libdc1394 and libraw1394
   - added a raw dumping option for the save thread: if the filename has
     an extension '.raw', the raw frame data is saved in binary format
     into the file, without any processing. This should be useful for
     people having 10 or 12 bit cameras.
   - updated some string alloc/free introduced by gnome-config
   - corrected some more conversions errors.
	
   Feb 6, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - small changes to configure macros.
   - changed some GUI layout in the preferences window
	
   Feb 6, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - added the shading of the audience frame (real preferences)
   - added the shading of the video device field (receive preferences)
   - upgraded the preferences parser to gnome-config, as suggested by Dan.
     This parser is *much better* indeed... Why reinvent the wheel? 
   - updated configure macros for libdc version
	
   Jan 27, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   updated the conversion functions:
     - optimized (in C, no MMX/SSE yet)
     - structured a full set of functions to pass from any IIDC format
       to UYVY and RGB (24bpp)
     - 16bpp grayscale modes are now supported, but Format_7 is still
       to be done. For 16bpp grayscale and 48bpp RGB, only the MSB is used
       with REAL and DISPLAY services. A function to dump raw data for
       saving to disk/ftp will be added.   

   Jan 31, 2002, by Dan Dennedy
     - Added video1394_device to preferences struct and preferences
       window. Coriander now requires CVS version of libdc1394
       until a new version is released. The CVS version of libdc1394
       also includes an updated kernel-video1394.h header. Therefore,
       for video1394 support, you must also be running ieee1394 from
       kernel 2.4.17 or linux1394 CVS since Oct 21.
     - added interface.patch file to be run against interface.c whenever
       Glade regenerates the code. The patch adds keyboard accellerator
       support to menus. This is easier to maintain than the manual
       instructions described in interface.mods.
     - prereferences window save function does not attempt to read
       widgets when RealServer/SDK not installed. Doing so creates
       empty values in the config file, and the config file parser 
       fails. Also, revised default values of some preferences items
       to replace spaces with underscores. The spaces also choke
       the config file parser. A better parser is needed. Why not 
       use gnome-config?
	
Changes in version 0.22:

   Jan 23, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - created some new macros for configure.in. The script now detects SDL
     properly, and also checks for libraw1394 and libdc1394.
	
   Jan 2, 2002, by Damien Douxchamps
   - removed individual string size, replaced by STRING_SIZE.
	
   Dec 31, 2001, by Damien Douxchamps
   - connected the trigger count widget.
   - changed the iso channel numbering policy: we now set
     iso_channel=node_id. This prevents serveral occurences of
     Coriander to mess with each other.
   - removed last GDK stuff in main.c
	
   Dec 29, 2001, by Damien Douxchamps
   - updated the real_audience preference: it should be a set of
     flags, not a single value.
   - node number and vendor added in camera name within the camera menu.

   Dec 28, 2001, by Damien Douxchamps
   - Added "keep aspect ratio" option for SDL resize
   - Moved some code from UpdatePrefs*Frames to BuildPrefs*Frame to
     avoid lockups
	
   Dec 25, 2001, by Damien Douxchamps
   - removed Xv and GDK display methods and associated controls

Changes in version 0.21:
   
   Dec 24, 2001, by Damien Douxchamps
   - SDL #ifdef debugged by Mark Hessman
   - screen can be resized in SDL.
   - added some keybindings to the SDL display:
     >: double size
     <: half size
     n: normal size
     f: toggle fullscreen mode
   - WARNING: due to the flexibility, stability, functionalities,
     performance (MMX optimized!) and ease of use of SDL, further
     versions of coriander will ONLY use it for display. This should
     not be a major issue because:
     - SDL nicely integrates overlay like Xv (for those who used Xv)
     - GDK display does not work on multithreaded programs anyway.
       Those who could not even use GDK will thus enjoy SDL.
     - SDL is available on every major platform.
     Coriander 0.21 is thus the last version to use Xv and GDK
     explicitely.

Changes in version 0.20:

    Dec 21, 2001, by Damien Douxchamps
    - A lot of debugging...
    - first implementation of an SDL display. No fullscreen or other
      fancy things: just a display. The rest will come later. 
    - added the name of the camera as porthole window title
	
    Dec 19, 2001, by Damien Douxchamps
    - Some compilation problems with gcc 2.91 cleaned after some input
      from Rick Philbrick.
	
    Dec 16, 2001, by Damien Douxchamps
    - changed all ranges look: replaced (radio-) buttons by a
      option_menu. A lot of code was updated.
    - moved the zoom, focus, tilt and pan functions to the main window
      notebook (a tab has been added). This will allow SDL display (in
      a distant future) and also multi-display (several cams and
      several displays handled by a single coriander program).
    - removed a lot of unsused callbacks.
    - added a period function to display and real threads, make the
      ones of save and ftp functionnal. Every image service can now run
      with its own framerate. The latter is a multiple of the receive
      service framerate (= camera framerate): 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4,... 
    - removed immediate/periodic modes because immmediate is the same
      as a period of 1.
	
    Dec 14, 2001, by Damien Douxchamps
    - make Real preference dialogs available only if Real is available
	
    Dec 14, 2001, by Damien Douxchamps
    - added a Real streaming service. This is not yet tested.
	
    Nov 26, 2001, by Damien Douxchamps:
    - added handle release and thread cleanup at the end of main.c
	
    Nov 20, 2001, by Damien Douxchamps:
    - added some #ifdef HAVE_FTPLIB to avoid compilation problems.
	
    Nov 12, 2001, by Damien Douxchamps:
    - updated the thread mechanism to allow multi-camera. Yeah, that
      feature had disappeared...
    - new small procedure to allow cameras to use different channels.
      This allows the use of several cameras threads at the same
      time. There is no support for multi-display at this time (i.e.
      running several coriander on several cams on one linux box).
    - change of formats and fps now works.
    - did some more cleanup of the code.

Changes in version 0.19b:

    Nov 26, 2001, by Damien Douxchamps:
    - new layout using "notebook" widget
	
Changes in version 0.19:

    Nov 6, 2001, by Damien Douxchamps:
    - MASSIVE code update/cleanup for threads. A little bit beta, but
      probably worth a try... I have designed a new structure as image
      pipe: images walk along this pipe and are successively used by
      different processes (threads). These threads currently are:
	iso: produces images at the beginning of the pipe (server)
	display: displays images on the screen (client)
	save: saves an image to a local file (client)
	ftp: sends an image on a ftp site (client)
	(a Real streaming client will be added in the future)
      About 30% of the code has been changed: you bet there'll be bugs
      lurking around! Please send some feedback about those... :*)
    - FTP is now working.
    - Due to the massive change in threads, some features have been moved
      to the preferences window. The capture window is now rather small...
	
    Oct 29, 2001, by Damien Douxchamps:
    - little cleanup/update of threads
    - first implementation of the preferences window. Use of a config
      file (~/.coriander).
    - removed unused items in menus like file saving.
	
Changes in version 0.18:

    Oct 26, 2001, by Damien Douxchamps:
    I did a large change concerning the capture and display: ISO receive
    and display threads have been changed from GTK threads to pthreads.
    This improves performances and avoid the locking bug of the external
    trigger function. A quick explaination: GTK thread are NOT real
    threads: if you use 'top' you will only see one process, even if
    several of these threads make Coriander. Real threads, on the other
    hand, will create multiple processes sharing the same memory space.
    It's better because 1) if a thread locks itself (e.g. waiting for a
    frame to come after a trigger), it will not lock the whole program
    and 2) several functions can be done at the same time (e.g. making
    continuous adjustments with sliders does not block the display). I
    noticed some better performance in general using pthreads, but it
    should be extensively tested. This version 0.18 is thus a little beta,
    as those who will probe the code will notice.
    - massive update of threads. The capture thread should be upgraded; it
      will come with the next version.
    
    Sept 26, 2001, by Damien Douxchamps:
    - corrected a bug concerning the camera select frame: table 9 was missing.
    - cleaned the ISO button callbacks and added proper button activation.
    - 'About' pixmap update, added a menu icon
	
    Sept 25, 2001, by Damien Douxchamps:
    - I removed some unfinalized things that were not making Coriander look
      professional
    - removed the feature locking frame in commander window, as well as the
      associated 'framework' code. It was let untouched for too long...
    - same thing for the slave-camera locking feature (commander window)
    - moved the ISO control into the space left by the feature locking int the
      commander window. That should make setup easier by avoiding systematic
      pop-up of the now-large capture window.
	
Changes in version 0.17:

    Sept 24, 2001, by Damien Douxchamps:
    - in an attempt to use radio buttons in the format selection menu, I
      changed the format/mode menu building procedure. Some parts have been
      left commented out, waiting for Glade to support menu-radio buttons
      in a better way. Some definitions have been created in definitions.c.
    - changed the compilation order in src/Makefile.am: definitions and tools
      have been moved 'up'.
    - removed the 'BuildFormat7Ranges' prompt to stdout.
    - removed BuildFormat7Ranges.c file from CVS
    - created UpdateFTPFrame in update_frame.c from Dan's code. Added label
      shading to field shading in order to make things clearer. The function
      has been added in the UpdateCaptureFrame window.
    - some cosmetic UI changes in FTP frame
    - updated version info to 0.17, README and AUTHORS
	
    Sept 18, 2001, by Dan Dennedy:
    - interface.c: bugfix the porthole window not scaling smoothly by adding
      a GtkAlignmentWidget
    - interface.c: remove the incomplete accelerator for video overlay 
      toggle button that was introduced yesterday.
    - callbacks.c: removed the on_camera_scope_size_allocate and
      on_camera_scape_size_request event handlers due to fix above.
    - capture.c: bugfix some dc1394_setup_catpure calls using the wrong
      handle introduced 2 days ago.

    Sept 17, 2001, by Dan Dennedy:
    - capture.c: optimize re-use of porthole buffer when capturing.
    - capture.c: increased counter capacity to limit of unsigned long
      and changed file format to include 10-digit number.
    - capture.c: apply speed detection code to a few more calls to
      dc1394_setup_capture.
    - capture.c, ftp: do not issue chdir if path is empty string.
    - tools.c: added MessageBox()
    - callbacks.c: enabling FTP without FtpLib invokes MessageBox.
    - added menu accelerators (see src/interface.mods)
    - removed international support from build

    Sept 16, 2001, by Dan Dennedy:
    - capture.c: bugfix major memory leak in multi-capture
    - capture.c: bugfix capture failing with video1394 loaded 
      and porthole not open
    - capture.c: factor out some code to a convert_to_yuv()
      function to achieve symmetry with convert_to_rgb()
    - added different capture frequencies: immediate (as fast
      as possible) and periodic (every X secs)
    - added different capture mode: sequentially nubmer file or
      continually overwrite same file
    - added ftp client option to capture based upon FtpLib, which
      is detected with autoconf and handled appropriately.
    - tools.c: added MainStatus()
	
Changes in version 0.17-pre1, July 25, 2001:

    - true error handling: data not used when an error is detected.
    - Bug fix: added "gdk_rgb_init();" in IsoStartThread() (capture.c)
      Thanks to John B. Burchett and Dan Dennedy.
    - due to the lack of updates I have removed the Japanese translation
      files (besides, I've failed to integrate these for some time)
    - Corrected some format7 code thanks to Olaf Ronneberger: in
      BuildFormat7ColorMenu and GetFormat7Capabilities, index like
      (0x1 << i) must be changed to (0x1 << (31-i)) (total: 2 occurences)
	
Changes in version 0.16, June 25, 2001:

    - added first Status window implementation. Enabled status window
      menu item in update_menus.c:line 42.
    - removed 250 lines in callbacks.c by creating ChangeModeAndFormat
      function in tools.c
    - added a notice in the 'no camera found' warning window for those
      who don't understand why their DV cameras are not detected (this
      should people from sending stop tons of emails)
    - moved iso_check/resume functions to tools.c
    - added a checkbox in the test pattern menu item.
    - repaired capture button enable when iso restart is clicked.
    - added maximal speed detection for devices on the bus: no more
      hard-typed SPEED_400!!!
    - first implementation of the status bar of the main window. This bar
      is currently only for error reporting.
	
Changes in version 0.15, May 23, 2001:

    - added Dan's patch for capture & overlay
    - added Marcus Lim code for test pattern display
	
Changes in version 0.14, May 16, 2001:

    - fixes several bugs related to multi-camera support.
    - removed cameras dc1394_init in main()
    - added an overlay enable button for the used for whom the overlay
      does not work well.
	
Changes in version 0.13, May 8, 2001:

    - Heavy code cleanup & bug fixes for overlay and capture. Thanks Dan!
    - some more bug fixes for multiple camera support. Note that overlay
      does not work with multiple cameras.
	
Changes in version 0.12, April 25, 2001:

    - added Japanese language support
    - upgraded for compatibility with latest libdc1394
    - added some more format6 and format7 preliminary stuff
    - some more bug fixes
	
Changes in version 0.11, March 29, 2001:

    - Code update from Dan Dennedy for video overlay: much better threads
      handeling.
    - First Format_6 window prototype
    - single/multi frame capture added by Dan Dennedy
          
Changes in version 0.10, March 19, 2001:

    - MASSIVE code update, cleanup and beautification. Functions of
      different kinds are defined: update and build. These operate on
      different objects: ranges, menus, frames and windows. This looks
      more and more like C++... Build functions all end up by the
      associated update function. Apart from that, build functions include
      the building of their 'sons'.
    - Addition of a video overlay in the porthole window. Many thanks to
      Dan Dennedy!! :-)
    - first implementation of Format_7 controls
	
Changes in version 0.09, Feb. 08, 2001:

    - changed several functions prototype to ...(void) instead of ...().
      This implied several changes to the callbacks.c file.
    - added configure to the sources to try solving a compatibility
      problem
    - corrected a window-size problem (Format_7 window)
	
Changes in version 0.08, Jan. 13, 2001:

    - iso flow control added in capture window: start/stop/restart
    - changed layout of main window
    - added the 'value' parameter for the external trigger ('count').
      Trigger is now 99.9% completed (only testing remains)
    - added a little logo on the main window
    - replaced global feature & camera structures by global pointers to
      these structures
    - introduced the camera selector menu
    - main.c now downloads data of all DC on the bus in a big structure.
    - changed all 'vboxes' that contained dynamic menus to 'tables' because
      it allows correct positioning of dynamicaly created widgets.
    - introduced a new structure: dc1394_misc_info
    - check that all 'set' commands also set the 3 global camera structures
    - finished vectorization and multi-camera switching
    - option menus are now coherent with the camera setup even at boot.
    - framerate menu check that current framerate is available for 
      format/mode. If not available, it switches to the nearest, preferably
      lowest framerate available
    - changed several constant index/boundaries and use instead DC1394
      definitions (like NUM_FRAMERATES,...)
	
Changes in version 0.07, Jan. 08, 2001:

    - intoduced Format_7 window
    - fixed a bug in auto/man mode: each one issued a callback at
      each state change so I removed the callbacks of AUTO mode and
      generalized the MAN mode callback.
    - iso flow is interrupted before fps/format/mode change and retored
      after the change. This avoids hangups in other programs using the
      iso flow.
    - update ranges when exiting from auto mode (ONLY WORKING FOR WHITEBAL
      when using DFW-VL500 bacause it seems this camera does not update all
      its registers in auto mode !)
    - removed disable of iris/gain/shutter during auto exposure (it was
      meaningless)

Changes in version 0.06, Jan. 04, 2001:

    - corrected trigger features: now 99.9% operational
    - corrected load/save memory feature: now 100% operational
    - uses new functions of libdc1394 for trigger, memory and Format_7
    - simplified fps menu generation & update
    - changed some functions names (Build-)
    - use of the dc1394_feature_set structure throughout the program
      as an information repository (synch'd w/ camera)
    - clearly dinstinguish ACTIVATE (at boot or camera select) and
      UPDATE (changing values)
    - DO NOT set any control in update functions (this yields a callback,
      then an update, thus a callback,... == infinite loop!)
    - auto exposure disables iris, gain and shutter
    - callback functions data as pointers to avoid warnings

Changes in version 0.05, Jan. 02, 2001:

    - ( first official release )
    - introduced the "Coriander" name (_that_ was a difficult change!)
    - improved 0.02 in many ways
    - temperature settings
    - capture settings
    - OP auto: momentary disable the command while working
    - auto mode: disable range value (it should be updated regularly)
    - dynamic option menus for fps and trigger mode
    - new 'About' window (Gnome default look)

Changes in version 0.02, Dec. 29, 2000:

    - first signal connections for scale widgets
	
Changes in version 0.01, Dec. 27, 2000:

    - first alpha version, still a lot of stuff missing...
