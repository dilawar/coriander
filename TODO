- video:
    	- I will add a button in the porthole window to quickly capture a file
      	  and save it to disk (this was previously called "capture single").
- refresh/update:
	- regularly update ranges in auto-mode
- multi-camera:
	- control-lock function for stereo cameras
	- indicate node number in menu (else you can't distinguish two cameras
	  of the same model) When GUID will be there, a custom name could be
	  attached to each cam.
- features:
	- add FORMAT_6 capabilities
	- add auto-lock, man-lock and current-setup-lock functions
	- hot plug capability (detect and handle bus reset)
	- some status window features missing
- misc stuff:
	- add some artwork in the buttons for clearer presentation
- threads:
	- Real streaming thread testing
	- failsafe thread manipulation: some checks should be performed
	  (typically during operation).
- long term:
	- add advanced features capability. This would probably require a
	  DB of the supported cameras (Is there any cam supporting this
	  anyway?)
	- record and play 'scenario' files (files containing a list of
	  timed commands)
