- video:
    	- I will add a button somewhere to quickly capture an image 
     	  and save it to disk (this was previously called "capture single").
- refresh/update:
	- regularly update ranges in auto-mode
- multi-camera:
	- control-lock function for stereo cameras
- features:
	- add FORMAT_6 capabilities
	- add auto-lock, man-lock and current-setup-lock functions
	- hot plug capability (detect and handle bus reset)
	- some status window features missing
	- absolute feature control
- misc stuff:
	- add some artwork in the buttons for clearer presentation
- services:
	- Real streaming service testing
- long term:
	- add advanced features capability. This would probably require a
	  DB of the supported cameras (Is there any cam supporting this
	  anyway?)
	- record and play 'scenario' files (files containing a list of
	  timed commands)
	- record and recall setup files
