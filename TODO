- urgent:
	- record and play 'scenario' files (files containing a list of
	  timed commands)
	- record and recall camera setup files
	- command line capability

- video:
    	- add a button somewhere to quickly capture an image and save it to
	  disk (this was previously called "capture single").
	- use available XV color modes to avoid conversions
	- allow downsampling for every service

- refresh/update:
	- regularly update ranges in auto-mode

- misc stuff:
	- add autofocus, autowhitebalance and autoexposure (autocontrast)
	  in software

-services:
	- add an SHM service
	- update the V4L service

- long term:
	- add advanced features capability. This would probably require a
	  DB of the supported cameras
