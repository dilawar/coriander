- video:
    	- add a button somewhere to quickly capture an image and save it to
	  disk (this was previously called "capture single").
	- use available XV color modes to avoid useless conversions

- refresh/update:
	- regularly update ranges in auto-mode

- misc stuff:
	- merge Johann's patch for a nice display window
	- add autofocus, autowhitebalance and autoexposure (autocontrast)
	  in software
	- upgrade fwrite to correct argument order
	- record and play 'scenario' files (files containing a list of
	  timed commands)
	- record and recall camera setup files
	- command line capability
	- add compilation flags such as -march=i686 and -mcpu=i686.
	- invert the two size args of function fwrite
	- avoid buttons that thave the same name

- services:
	- add an SHM service
	- update the V4L service
	- protect overwriting files with a confirmation dialog
	- When a video is being saved, it should not be possible to change
	  the camera mode (it should be greyed out, or should end the save if
	  hanged); or should prompt user to supply a new file name to continue
	  saving (or some combination of above?).
	- save to stdout
	- patch for ffmpeg (jpeg and video)
	- add 16bit bayer pattern demosaicing
	- add service/ISO autostart in the preferences.

- long term:
	- add advanced features capability. This would probably require a
	  DB of the supported cameras
