- video:
    	- add a button somewhere to quickly capture an image and save it to
	  disk (this was previously called "capture single").
	- use available XV color modes to avoid useless conversions

- refresh/update:
	- regularly update ranges in auto-mode

- misc stuff:
	- merge Johann's patch for a nice display window
	- add autofocus, autowhitebalance and autoexposure (autocontrast)
	  in software
	- upgrade fwrite to correct argument order
	- record and play 'scenario' files (files containing a list of
	  timed commands)
	- record and recall camera setup files
	- command line capability
	- avoid buttons that have the same name (save setup/power)
	- update phy speed detection with raw1394 (currently it does not work
	  with 1394b)
	- check that libdc1394 version is correctly probed.

- services:
	- add an SHM service
	- update the V4L service
	- protect overwriting files with a confirmation dialog
	- When a video is being saved, it should not be possible to change
	  the camera mode (it should be greyed out, or should end the save if
	  hanged); or should prompt user to supply a new file name to continue
	  saving (or some combination of above?).
	- save to stdout
	- add 16bit bayer pattern demosaicing
	- add service/ISO autostart in the preferences. Warn in status window if
	  services not started in the 'normal' order.
	- handle the case where no extension is provided
	- thread_save button should self-reset after finishing to write the
	  RAM buffer to disk
	- filename preview should be updated
	- for video, check previously written files to set the number to append
	- confirm overwrite files
	- use dummy menu items in the save format menu (stills/video)
	- option to propagate the display pattern in the rest of the pipe
	- integrate MPEG patch
	- verify the compilation flags originally used for mpeg (-mmx,...)
	- add options to MPEG service (codec, basic params?)
	- FTP seems to be broken. To be checked.

- long term:
	- add advanced features capability. This would probably require a
	  DB of the supported cameras
