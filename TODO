_______________________________________________________________________________

- video:
    	- add a button somewhere to quickly capture an image and save it to
	  disk (this was previously called "capture single").
	- use available XV color modes to avoid useless conversions

- refresh/update:
	- regularly update ranges in auto-mode

- misc stuff:
	- merge Johann's patch for a nice display window
	- add autofocus, autowhitebalance and autoexposure (autocontrast)
	  in software
	- record and play 'scenario' files (files containing a list of
	  timed commands)
	- record and recall camera setup files
	- command line capability
	- avoid buttons that have the same name (save setup/power)
	- update phy speed detection with raw1394 (currently it does not work
	  with 1394b)
	- check that libdc1394 version is correctly probed.

- services:
	- add an SHM service
	- update the V4L service
	- protect overwriting files with a confirmation dialog
	- When a video is being saved, it should not be possible to change
	  the camera mode (it should be greyed out, or should end the save if
	  hanged); or should prompt user to supply a new file name to continue
	  saving (or some combination of above?).
	- save to stdout
	- add 16bit bayer pattern demosaicing
	- add service/ISO autostart in the preferences. Warn in status window if
	  services not started in the 'normal' order.
	- handle the case where no extension is provided
	- thread_save button should self-reset after finishing to write the
	  RAM buffer to disk, or if the thread self-terminate (error,...)
	- filename preview should be updated
	- for video, check previously written files to set the number to append
	- confirm overwrite files
	- option to propagate the display pattern in the rest of the pipe
	- MPEG libraries should be probed (including libjpeg *and* libjpeg-mmx)
	- add options to MPEG service (codec, basic params?)
	- FTP should be upgraded when the save service is completed and tested
	- errors should be sent to dialogs, not in the status window which is only
	  good for warnings/status messages
	- option for the RECEIVE service to get frames from the DMA buffer only if
	  the frames have been used by the following service. Previously, the advantage
	  of the DMA buffer were lost after the ISO thread, which could typically lead
	  to dropped frames in the save service
	- report frames that were dropped by the kernel drivers
	- implement the display overlay with used-specified images
	- create an "mencoder" service or capability

- long term:
	- add advanced features capability. This would probably require a
	  DB of the supported cameras
