- video:
	- update rate different from camera rate
	- external trigger freezes the GUI. To be fixed.
- refresh/update:
	- regularly update ranges in auto-mode
- multi-camera:
	- control-lock function for stereo cameras
	- indicate node number in menu (else you can't distinguish two cameras
	  of the same model)
- programming:
	- better update of format menu (merge callbacks)
- features:
	- deal with the FORMAT_7 (callbacks,...)
	- add FORMAT_6 capabilities  
	- save/load setup file
	- add auto-lock, man-lock and setup-lock functions
	- hot plug capability (-> detect and handle bus reset)
	- some status window features missing
- misc stuff:
	- add some artwork in the buttons for clearer presentation
- long term:
	- add advanced features capability. This would probably require a
	  DB of the supported cameras
	- record and play 'scenario' files (files containing a list of
	  timed commands)
