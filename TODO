- video:
    	- add a button somewhere to quickly capture an image and save it to
	  disk (this was previously called "capture single").

- refresh/update:
	- regularly update ranges in auto-mode
	- position of video overaly does not follow window position when not
	  receiving any frame.

- multi-camera:
	- control-lock function for stereo cameras

- features:
	- add FORMAT_6 capabilities
	- add auto-lock, man-lock and current-setup-lock functions
	- some status window features missing

- misc stuff:
	- add some artwork in the buttons for clearer presentation
	- add autofocus, autowhitebalance and autoexposure (autocontrast)
	  in software.

- long term:
	- add advanced features capability. This would probably require a
	  DB of the supported cameras (Is there any cam supporting this
	  anyway?)
	- record and play 'scenario' files (files containing a list of
	  timed commands)
	- record and recall camera setup files
