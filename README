(This README is for version 0.31)

Hello world!

Coriander is a GUI for controlling a Digital Camera (in the sense of
the IIDC specs issued by the 1394 Trade Association [1]). Due to the
properties of the IEEE1394 protocol, Coriander can control an IEEE1394
camera without interferring with the image flow from that camera. It
can thus be used to setup a camera with Coriander while the video flow
is used by another application (at least if the porthole display is
switched off).

				**********

IMPORTANT NOTE: Coriander will NOT work with consumer-grade DV
cameras (e.g. cameras in which you can insert a tape). These cameras
should be controlled with he AV/C protocol, please refer to [8]. Also,
not all industrial cameras are IIDC specs-compliant. Check [7] to have a
list of currently supported cameras.

				**********

Most image processing scientists using 1394 cameras under Linux know
about the libdc1394 library [2]. However, it's a real problem when you
need to quickly setup a demo or get some frames for testing. If, just
like me, you also had this problem, Coriander is for you [4]!

This version can be considered as 'stable but with room for
improvements'. Please have a look at the TODO, ChangeLog and BUGS
files to see the current status of the project. Contributors are most
welcome so if you're interrested in making this program better don't
hesitate to contact me.

The latest version can be found on the SourceForge website:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/coriander

If you're wondering about a user manual, I'm afraid there's nothing
close to that available right now. I don't think it's absolutely
necessary: the GUI should be self-explanatory.

As I can only test Coriander with the camera I have (a DFW-VL500 from
Sony), a lot of features have NOT been tested, and I just can't do it
in an easy way.  If you have another camera, please test Coriander and
send me an email with the bugs you identified.

'Hope you enjoy this software (well if you don't, just contribute to
make it better! ;-)

Install instructions:
_______________________

Basically, you should just type:

./autogen.sh
make
make install

If you have troubles, please read the INSTALL file provided.



Hardware requirements:
_______________________

- A linux box,
- an 1394 interface card (PCI, CardBus, whatever...). Try to get an
  OHCI card as their support is better under linux.
- a digital camera compatible with DC specs v1.04 or later.



Software requirements:
_______________________

Software requirements are now more or less correctly probed by the configure
script: libdc1394, libraw1394, MMX/SSE capabilities, libftp and SDL libs are
checked.

- a kernel with 1394 support [3], preferably at least a 2.4.17
  WITH CVS for ieee1394 at a date later than 2001-12-20 (very important).
  Kernel modules to be compiled: ieee1394, ohci1394, raw1394 and video1394
- XFree 3.3.6 (XFree 4.1.0 recommended for video overlay)
- Gtk 1.2 & Gtk-devel
- libraw1394 [5] and libdc1394 [2] installed. A CVS version of libdc1394 later
  than 2002-02-01 is required. 
- ftplib installed for FTP support [9]
- SDL installed for display support [11]
- Glade (for development only)
- automake 1.4
- autoconf 2.13

In order to have Xv support within SDL, you will maybe need some custom
drivers, e.g. for Nvidia chipsets [10] or for ATI Rage chipsets [6].
