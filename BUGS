Known bugs:

- The Sony DFW-VL500 has several bugs in its early software versions. This is
  mentionned in the camera user's manual (which is not supplied with the
  camera!). These bugs are:
        - whitebal controls only work when a previous 'load factory setup' has
          been done
        - the RESET function is not working
	- saving setups is not fully working
- The test pattern generation is only working with some cameras.
- FTP was reported not to be working. 'Have to do more testing on that.
