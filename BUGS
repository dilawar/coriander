Things that are still under heavy development (if developed at all):

- all auto/man/lock

Known bugs:

- The Sony DFW-VL500 has several bugs in its early software versions. This is
  mentionned in the camera user's manual. These bugs are:
        - whitebal controls only work when a previous 'load factory setup' has
          been done
        - the RESET function is not working
	- saving setups is not fully working
- The test pattern generation is only working with some cameras.
