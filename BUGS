Known bugs for version 0.20:

- The Sony DFW-VL500 has several bugs in its early software versions. This is
  mentionned in the camera user's manual (which is not supplied with the
  camera!). These bugs are:
        - whitebal controls only work when a previous 'load factory setup' has
          been done
        - the RESET function is not working
	- saving setups is not fully working
- The test pattern generation is only working with some cameras.
- The new thread mechanism is working but needs more testing.
- The REAL service is untested and only runs with some distros. It does not
  work on RH-7.2
- Display is a little bit bugged but I think it's due to my 1394 subsystem
  version.
