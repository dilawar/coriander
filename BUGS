Known bugs for version 0.99.9:

- If you want to use coriander remotely, i.e. run coriander on
  a remote machine with a display export, the BPP settings of
  computer displays should be the same.
- F7 seems to have some troubles during capture: changing mode
  format even only once disable any further capture until the
  camera is rebooted. This happens only with some cameras.
