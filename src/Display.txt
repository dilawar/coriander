Some remarks about the new experimental live display.

We have to deal with five rectangles:

a - The image received from the camera. It's size and depth can be changed from 
    the control panel or by cropping, in which case b and c should adapt.

b - The imaginairy SDL rectangle where the source image would be splashed using current 
    camera and zoom settings. Don't worry :), it's visable area is c, so it's 
    "content" will only be splashed using those limits.

c - The display window is a viewport to b (could be larger or smaller) using current 
    pan settings. It can be changed by resizing the window.

d - The selection can be made inside the display window

e - The crop area is d adapted to the camera's capabilities

Thats it for now. Most of the "TODO" marks will either be explaned here or dealt with.
